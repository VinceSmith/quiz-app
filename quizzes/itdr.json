  "paper_markdown": "# ITDR: Identity Threat Detection and Response\n\nIdentity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) treats the identity plane—users, service principals, devices, and their tokens—as a first‑class attack surface. The job is simple to say: see identity attacks early, stop them quickly, and leave clean, auditable trails. In practice, ITDR fuses signals from your IdP, directories, privilege systems, and apps to find misuse, then executes fast, safe response.\n\n## Why ITDR now\n\nPhishing kits, password reuse, MFA fatigue, and token replay have made identity the easiest door. Once an identity is abused, attackers move laterally and escalate until they reach high‑value data. Network perimeters help less in cloud and hybrid paths; ITDR brings the “SOC mindset” directly to identities.\n\n## The identity attack flow (typical)\n\nA typical identity intrusion starts with initial access, often via password spraying, phishing for credentials, replaying a stolen token, or compromising a device that already holds a valid session. With a foothold established, the attacker seeks persistence by granting risky app consents, creating backdoor accounts, or weakening guardrails such as conditional access policies. Next comes privilege escalation: roles are granted, just‑in‑time (PIM/JIT) processes are bypassed or abused, and MFA may be disabled for key users. With elevated access, lateral movement follows as tokens and credentials are reused to pivot across apps, tenants, or environments. Finally, the operation reaches its objectives—reading or tampering with data, exfiltrating it at scale, or staging for ransomware—while attempting to blend in with normal administrative activity.\n\n## Core ITDR signals to collect\n\nEffective ITDR begins with visibility. Authentication telemetry—successful and failed sign‑ins, new device indicators, client types, and geolocation/IP attributes—provides early hints of abuse. Directory and IdP change logs reveal account creation and deletion, role and group changes, and policy edits that can quietly open doors. Privilege and session events, including PIM/JIT requests, administrative tool usage, and token revocations, show how access is requested and exercised over time. Application consent and OAuth events expose new service principals, scope expansions, and potentially risky delegations. Device posture adds useful context when available, such as compliance or join state and EDR‑reported risk. Above all, ITDR benefits from correlation across these sources so that accounts, devices, IPs, and token claims can be linked into a coherent picture.\n\n## Detections by stage\n\n### 1) Initial access\n\nLook for spray patterns where many accounts receive a small set of passwords from the same IP or ASN. “Impossible travel” or sudden geographic jumps without trusted device signals suggest session theft or credential reuse. Spikes in MFA prompts, rapid deny/approve oscillations, or unusual push approvals indicate MFA fatigue abuse. First‑time sign‑ins from new clients or legacy, unsigned protocols should also draw attention.\n\n### 2) Foothold and persistence\n\nAfter entry, adversaries often seek staying power. Risky app consents appear, sometimes granting broad scopes like mail.read or files.read.all from non‑admin contexts. New accounts may be created or powerful roles such as Global Administrator or Owner assigned outside of standard processes. You may see mailbox rules or forwarding enabled en masse, including external auto‑forwarding, and conditional access policies quietly weakened by adding bypass locations or enabling legacy authentication.\n\n### 3) Privilege escalation\n\nEscalation is visible when permanent role elevation replaces expected JIT patterns. Disabling MFA for high‑value identities, removing strong factors, or altering key directory settings outside change windows are further warning signs that control of the environment is slipping.\n\n### 4) Lateral movement\n\nWatch for service accounts performing interactive or geographically diverse sign‑ins, which they typically should not. Token reuse across distant IPs or distinct device fingerprints suggests replay or session theft. Surges in administrative tooling such as remote PowerShell or AzureAD/MS Graph calls from unusual operators or times can signal pivoting activity.\n\n### 5) Data access and exfiltration\n\nMass downloads, bulk mailbox access, rapid sharing link creation, or a suspicious app consent directly preceding large data reads all point to the objective phase. These patterns deserve immediate containment while containment remains possible.\n\n## Response playbooks (fast and safe)\n\nWhen identity abuse is confirmed or strongly suspected, move in a measured sequence. First, revoke active sessions and refresh tokens so new proofs are required; prompt re‑authentication under stronger policy. Immediately reset passwords and re‑enroll MFA as needed, and rotate application secrets and keys that could be reused. Disable or quarantine the identity—user or service principal—while you investigate scope and blast radius. Remove risky consents and require administrator approval for sensitive scopes going forward. Use conditional access to block by IP, ASN, or device class and, if needed, isolate devices through EDR to stop live hands‑on‑keyboard activity. Throughout, notify owners, open tickets automatically, and preserve the full trail of evidence for audit and learning.\n\n## Preventive controls that help ITDR\n\nPrevention raises the bar and makes signals cleaner. Adopt phishing‑resistant MFA such as FIDO2 or certificate‑based methods and enforce strong conditional access by context. Run least‑privilege by default and rely on PIM/JIT for short, auditable elevations. Reduce legacy exposure by disabling old protocols, enforcing sound password hygiene, rotating service credentials, and retiring stale identities. Centralize IdP, directory, and application logs with enough retention to investigate meaningfully across weeks or months.\n\n## What to measure\n\nTrack time to detect (TTD) and time to revoke (TTR) sessions and tokens to understand how quickly you cut off misuse. Measure mean time to contain (MTTC) compromised identities to ensure response playbooks are effective. Watch coverage metrics—the percentage of privileged identities with MFA and JIT enabled, and the proportion of relevant log sources onboarded—to avoid blind spots. Finally, monitor signal quality, including false‑positive rates and alert fatigue trends, so you can tune detections without losing sensitivity.\n\n## Limits and realities\n\nITDR can block remote replay and catch abuse quickly, but a fully compromised endpoint can still drive a legitimate session (“use‑without‑exfiltration”). Keep device security strong, shorten token lifetimes, constrain scopes/audiences, and watch for anomalies.\n\n**Bottom line.** Treat the identity plane as critical infrastructure: collect the right signals, detect by stage, and respond decisively with revocation, reset, consent cleanup, and least‑privilege by default.",
